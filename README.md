![App Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GetInfo-ACN/MacSaverBuilder/main/Screenshots/App_Banner.png)

Screen savers are standard security controls used to limit access to a Mac and the user's session when the Mac is idle or left unattended. Mac Saver Builder is an innovative tool that allows you to create custom screen savers for macOS. This application caters to two primary user groups:

**IT Professionals (#MacAdmins):**

*   IT teams managing macOS devices (#MacAdmins) can use the app to easily create screen savers compliant with security standards (CIS, NIST, DISA STIG, etc.) across the organization.

**End Users:**

*   Designed for individuals who want to create unique screen savers tailored to their personal style.

The application takes **video files (.mp4, .mov)** and **small images (.jpg, .png)** and generates screen savers in .saver format. This output is suitable for both manual installation and MDM distribution. While **Mac Saver Builder** is a signed application, the .saver files generated by the app are unsigned.

## **Demo 🚀**

With Mac Saver Builder, simply drag and drop or select your video and image files to quickly generate .saver screen savers.

## **Known Issues ⚠️**

Since Apple began moving the native Screen Saver system to the .appex format, there have been some incompatibilities with the traditional .saver format. These incompatibilities can be more noticeable when end users create multiple .saver files. However, these issues are generally less common in MDM-managed single .saver deployments.

In the Screen Saver section, preview may sometimes appear as a black screen. Selecting a different screen saver and then returning to the previous one can resolve the preview issue. 

When multiple traditional .saver files exist, switching between them may cause instability. In such cases, restarting the Mac or using **Activity Monitor** to **“Force Quit”** the `legacyScreenSaver (Wallpaper)` process can fix the issue.
